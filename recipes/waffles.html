                    <p><u>Step 2</u></p>

                    <p class="Instructions">Waffles Toppings</p>
                    <p>For the most traditional experience, top each waffle with butter and maple syrup. But that's not the only way to enjoy this top-rated recipe! Try one of these delicious ways to take your waffles up a notch:</p>
                    <li>Blueberry sauce</li>
                    <li>Nuts (such as pecans or walnuts)</li>
                    <li>Vanilla glaze</li>
                    <li> Nutella</li>
                    <li>Homemade whipped cream</li>
                    <li> Fresh berries (such as blueberries or strawberries)</li>
               <p class="Instructions">Instructions</p>
               <p><u>step 1:</u></p>
               <p>Begin by preheating your waffle iron as per the instructions provided by the manufacturer, ensuring it reaches the optimal temperature for perfect waffle preparation.</p>
               <p><u>step 2:</u></p>
               <p>In a large bowl, whisk the eggs vigorously until they become light and fluffy, creating a velvety texture. Proceed by adding the flour, milk, and vegetable oil to the bowl, and mix all the ingredients together until they are well combined, forming a smooth batter. Next, incorporate the sugar into the mixture, gently whisking it in.</p>
               <p><u>step 3:</u></p>
               <p>To achieve the desired light and airy texture, introduce the baking powder, salt, and vanilla into the batter. Take care not to overmix the ingredients; a few gentle stirs should be sufficient to create a smooth consistency without compromising the final result.</p>
               <p><u>step 4:</u></p>
               <p>Now, it's time to prepare the waffle iron for cooking. Spray the preheated waffle iron with nonstick spray, ensuring an even coating to prevent the waffles from sticking. This step will help facilitate the smooth release of the cooked waffles.</p>
               <p><u>step 5:</u></p>
               <p>With the waffle iron properly prepared, pour the batter onto the hot surface. Spread it evenly, allowing it to fill the waffle iron compartments. Close the lid and cook the waffles until they turn a delightful golden brown hue and the waffle iron stops emitting steam. This process typically takes around 3 to 5 minutes, but cooking times may vary depending on the specific waffle iron and desired crispness.</p>
               <p><u>step 6:</u></p>
               <p>Once cooked to perfection, carefully remove the waffles from the iron, and they're ready to be enjoyed! Serve them hot, accompanied by your favorite toppings and syrups for a delightful breakfast or any time of the day treat.</p>
